Upgrade Steps
Upgrade from 0.1.* to 0.2

1) Enter database details into upgrade-0.1.3_to_2.0.php
	(Replace DATABASE_USERNAME, DATABASE_NAME and
	 DATABASE_PASSWORD with applicable information)
2) Run upgrade-0.1.3_to_2.0.php
3) If upgrade-0.1.3_to_2.0.php ran successfully (no error messages) then
	delete it.
4) Use PHPGSB as you did before. NOTE: There has been an internal
rearrangement in the functions of the class and so those not using
runUpdate() (and who are accessing functions directly) may need to
check their code.

NOTE: Upgrade may take some time on established databases for MySQL
to convert records over to the InnoDB system. (Required to provide
performance improvements in long term.)
